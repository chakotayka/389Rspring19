Who should you tell, if anybody?

I think that you should first tell your boss and anyone in the company who is responsible for making the decision to fix the problems.  I would be wary to make the knowledge public because that could lead hackers to find out about it more easily and exploit the vulnerabilities immediately.  If the bugs might cause someone’s death, I would feel that the company should make the knowledge public and either provide a fix as soon as possible or have a recall on the cars.   If this firmware hasn’t been released yet, I would try to persuade the company not to release it until it can be fixed.

How far should you go, if at all?  What if your company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release?

First of all, it would be important to remind the company of the potential lawsuits if people did die and it was discovered that the company knew about the isssues.  If appealing to their morals doesn’t work, perhaps the threat of losing millions of dollars in lawsuits and losing significant reputation might dissuade them.  After all, it is very difficult to regain reputation and trust after it is lost.  I would be surprised if they would not be willing to wait 6 months if they were willing to have an audit last for 6 months.   However, if they were willing to put their customers’ lives in danger, I don’t think that is a company I would want to work for, and if I was not legally binded by a nondisclosure agreement I might release a warning about the cars.


If you do nothing, are you responsible for any harm that results? Why or why not?

I think legally I would not be responsible for harm if I told the appropriate people in the company about the problems.  However morally I would feel guilty if someone got hurt.
